🎯 The Mission

Ever feel like someone’s peeking over your shoulder when you’re online? Not literally (hopefully), but your ISP, advertisers, and that one shady coffee shop Wi-Fi all want a piece of your browsing history.

My task? Fire up a VPN, test it, and see if my online presence could go incognito — without breaking my internet speed or my patience.

🛠 My Chosen Weapon: ProtonVPN

I went with ProtonVPN Free Tier for three reasons:

No-logs policy — they claim they don’t care about my cat video habits.

AES-256 encryption — basically the Fort Knox of data security.

Based in Switzerland — where even the mountains respect privacy. 🏔️

🚀 Step 1 — Suiting Up

Created a free ProtonVPN account (took about 2 minutes).

Downloaded the Windows client.

Clicked “Install” → Waited → Boom, VPN armor equipped.

🌍 Step 2 — Choosing My Secret Base

The app suggested the fastest free server — Netherlands.

Before VPN: My IP said, “Yep, that’s him, living right there.”
After VPN: My IP claimed I was hanging out in the Netherlands.
Nice. I could almost smell the stroopwafels.

🌐 Step 4 — Field Test

I opened a few websites — no glitches, no suspicious lag.
Ran a DNS leak test — all clean.
Internet speed dropped slightly, but nothing that made YouTube cry.

🛡 What a VPN Really Does for You

Hides your real IP from nosy trackers

Encrypts your traffic so even public Wi-Fi can’t rat you out

Bypasses geo-blocks (Netflix, I’m looking at you)

Keeps your ISP from selling your browsing history to advertisers

⚠ The Fine Print (VPN Limitations)

You might lose a bit of speed

Free plans = fewer servers to choose from

It’s not a magic invisibility cloak — malware and phishing still work if you click the wrong thing

💡 Final Thoughts

Setting up ProtonVPN felt like putting on sunglasses and walking into a spy movie. The IP change was instant, the encryption solid, and the speed drop small enough to ignore.

If you care about privacy, use a VPN. If you don’t care… well, your ISP probably th
